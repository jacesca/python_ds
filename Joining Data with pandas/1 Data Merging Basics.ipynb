    ">Welcome! I am Aaren Stubberfield and I will be your instructor for this course. The Pandas package is a powerful tool for manipulating and transforming data in Python. However, when working on an analysis, the data needed could be in multiple tables. This course will focus on the vital skill of merging tables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. For clarity**\n",
    ">As we start, two quick clarifications. First, through other courses on DataCamp, you may have learned how to import tabular data as DataFrames. In this course, you may hear the words table and DataFrame, but they are equivalent here. Second, we will refer to combining different tables together as merging tables, but note that some refer to this same process as joining.\n",

    ">(1) Photo by Pedro Lastra on Unsplash\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Datasets for example**\n",
    ">The city of Chicago is divided into fifty local neighborhoods called wards. We have a table with data about the local government offices in each ward. In this example, we want to merge the local government data with census data about the population of each ward.\n",
    ">(1) Ward image By Alissapump, Own work, CC BY-SA 3.0\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. The ward data**\n",
    ">If we look at the wards table, we have information about the local government of each ward, such as the government office address. This table has 50 rows and 4 columns, or one row for each ward.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Census data**\n",
    ">The census table contains the population of each ward in 2000 and 2010, and that change as a percentage. Additionally, it includes the address for the center of each ward. This table has 50 rows and 6 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Merging tables**\n",
    ">The two tables are related by their ward column. We can merge them together, matching the ward number from each row of the wards table to the ward numbers from the census table. For example, the second ward in the wards table with Alderman Brian Hopkins would be matched with row 2 of the census table where the population in 2000 was 54,361.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Inner join**\n",
    ">The pandas package has an excellent DataFrame method for performing this type of merge called merge. The merge method takes the first DataFrame, wards, and merges it with the second DataFrame, census. We use the on argument to tell the method that we want to merge the two DataFrames on the ward column. Since we listed the wards table first, its columns will appear first in the output, followed by the columns from the census table. In this example, the merge returns a DataFrame with 50 rows and 9 columns, where the returned rows have matching values for the ward column in both tables. This is called an inner join.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Inner join**\n",
    ">An inner join will only return rows that have matching values in both tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Suffixes**\n",
    ">You may have noticed that the merged table has columns with suffixes of underscore x or y. This is because both the wards and census tables contained address and zip columns. To avoid multiple columns with the same name, they are automatically given a suffix by the merge method.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Suffixes**\n",
    ">We can use the suffix argument of the merge method to control this behavior. We provide a tuple where all of the overlapping columns in the left table are given the suffix '_ward', and those of the right table will be given the suffix '_cen'. This makes it easier for us to tell the difference between the columns.\n",

However, in steps 2 and 3, using the altered tables with the altered first row of the ward column, the number of returned rows was fewer. There was not a matching value in the ward column of the other table. Remember that .merge() only returns rows where the values match in both tables.</font>"

Every row in the wards table is related to only one row in the census table, so there is only one row for ward 3 in each table.

Notice that ward 1 and its alderman Joe is repeated in the resulting table because the licenses table has many businesses in the 1st ward. Pandas takes care of the one-to-many relationships for us and doesn't require anything special on our end. We can use the same syntax as we did with one-to-one relationships.\n",

In this lesson, you will explore this further by finding out what is the most common business owner title. (i.e., secretary, CEO, or vice president)\n",

    "**1. Merging multiple DataFrames**\n",
    ">Welcome back. In our last lesson, we learned how to merge two tables with a one-to-many relationship using the merge method. Merging data like this is a necessary skill to bring together data from different sources to answer some more complex data questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Merging multiple tables**\n",
    ">Sometimes we need to merge together more than just two tables to complete our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Remembering the licenses table**\n",
    ">In the previous lesson, we used two tables from the city of Chicago. One table contained business licenses issued by the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Remembering the wards table**\n",
    ">The other table listed info about the local neighborhoods called wards, including the local government official's office.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Review new data**\n",
    ">Now, we also have a table of businesses that have received small business grant money from Chicago. The grants are funded by taxpayer money. Therefore, it would be helpful to analyze how much grant money each business received and in what ward that business is located. We then could determine if one ward's businesses received a disproportionately large amount of grant money.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Tables to merge**\n",
    ">To pull all of this information together, let's first connect our grants table to our licenses table. The two tables are related by their company name and location. Let's pause here for a moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Theoretical merge**\n",
    ">If we merge the two tables only using the zip column, then the 60616 zip of Reggie's bar from the licenses table will be matched to multiple businesses in the grants table with the same zip. Our code sample prints the first few rows and some columns of the merged table. The output of the merge duplicates Reggie's bar for each matching zip in the grants table, which is not what we want. If instead, we merged on address only, there's a small risk that the address would repeat in different parts of the city. Therefore, the best option is to merge the tables using the combination of both address and zip code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8. Single merge**\n",
    ">We merge the two DataFrames as shown before, except in this case, we pass a list of the column names we want to merge on to the 'on' argument. This allows us to use multiple columns in the merge. As before, the matching rows between the two DataFrames are returned with the columns from the grant table listed first. However, when we merge on two columns, in this case address and zip code, we are requiring that both the address and zip code of a row in the left table match the address and zip code of a row in the right table in order for them to be linked to each other in the merge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**9. Merging multiple tables**\n",
    ">We can now extend this example to a third table. First, we merge the grants table with the wards table on the ward column again, adding suffixes to the repeated column names. Note that we're using Python's backslash line continuation method to add the second merge on the next line. Python will read this as just one line of code. Without this, Python will throw a syntax error since it will parse it as two separate lines of code, so don't forget your backslash. Now our output table has information about grants, business, and wards. We can now complete our analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**10. Results**\n",
    ">We can now sum the grants by ward and plot the results. Some wards have received more grants than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**11. Merging even more...**\n",

However, you have to choose a location in the city to put your goat farm. You need a location with a great deal of space and relatively few businesses and people around to avoid complaints about the smell. You will need to merge three tables to help you choose your location. The land_use table has info on the percentage of vacant land by city ward. The census table has population by ward, and the licenses table lists businesses by ward.\n",
