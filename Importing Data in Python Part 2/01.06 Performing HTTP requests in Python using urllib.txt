INSTRUCTION:
1. Import the functions urlopen and Request from the 
   subpackage urllib.request.
2. Package the request to the url 
	"http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation" 
   using the function Request() and assign it to request.
3. Send the request and catch the response in the variable 
   response with the function urlopen().
4. Run the rest of the code to see the datatype of response 
   and to close the connection!

GUIDE:
Performing HTTP requests in Python using urllib
Now that you know the basics behind HTTP GET requests, 
it's time to perform some of your own. In this interactive 
exercise, you will ping our very own DataCamp servers to 
perform a GET request to extract information from our 
teach page, 
	"http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation".

In the next exercise, you'll extract the HTML itself. 
Right now, however, you are going to package and send 
the request and then catch the response.
