INSTRUCTION:
1. Pass the variable url to the requests.get() function 
   in order to send the relevant request and catch the 
   response, assigning the resultant response message 
   to the variable r.
2. Apply the json() method to the response object r 
   and store the resulting dictionary in the variable 
   json_data.
3. Hit Submit Answer to print the key-value pairs of 
   the dictionary json_data to the shell.

GUIDE:
AJSON–from the web to Python
Wow, congrats! You've just queried your first API
 programmatically in Python and printed the text of 
the response to the shell. However, as you know, your 
response is actually a JSON, so you can do one step 
better and decode the JSON. You can then print the 
key-value pairs of the resulting dictionary. That's 
what you're going to do now!
