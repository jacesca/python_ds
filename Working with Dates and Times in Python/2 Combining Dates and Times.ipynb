Throughout the Washington, D.C. area, you will find these special bike docks, where riders can pay to take a bike, ride it, and return to this or any other station in the network. We will be following one bike, ID number \"W20529\", on all the trips it took in October, November, and December of 2017. Each trip consisted of a date and time when a bike was undocked from a station, then some time passed, and the date and time when W20529 was docked again.\n",

    "\n",
    "**2. Printing datetimes**\n",
    ">First, let's create a datetime again. dt corresponds to December 30, 2017 at 15:19:13, the end of the last trip that W20529 takes in our data set. Just like with date objects, we use strftime() to create a string with a particular format. First, we'll just print the year, month and date, using the same format codes we used for dates. % capital Y stands for the four digit year, % lowercase m for the month, and % lowercase d for the day of the month. Now we can add in the hours, minutes and seconds. Again, we print the year, month and day, and now we add three more format codes: % capital H gives us the hour, % capital M gives us the minute, and % capital S gives us the seconds. There are also format codes for 12-hour clocks, and for printing the correct AM or PM.\n",

    "**4. ISO 8601 Format**\n",
    ">Finally, we can use the isoformat() method, just like with dates, to get a standards-compliant way of writing down a datetime. The officially correct way of writing a datetime is the year, month, day, then a capital T, then the time in 24 hour time, followed by the minute and second. When in doubt, this is a good format to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Parsing datetimes with strptime**\n",
    ">We can also parse dates from strings, using the same format codes we used for printing. You'll use this often when getting date and time data from the Internet since dates and times are often represented as strings. We start, as before, by importing the datetime class.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6. Parsing datetimes with strptime**\n",
    ">The method we're going to use is called strptime(), which is short for string parse time. strptime() takes two arguments: the first argument is the string to turn into a datetime, and the second argument is the format string that says how to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7. Parsing datetimes with strptime**\n",

    "**8. Parsing datetimes with strptime**\n",
    ">Then we pass the format string, which as mentioned before uses the same format codes we used with strftime(). In this case, first the month, then the day, then the year, all separated by slashes, then a space, and then the hour, minutes, and seconds separated by colons. You usually need to figure this out once per data set.\n",

    "**9. Parsing datetimes with strptime**\n",

    "**11. Parsing datetimes with Pandas**\n",

Many computers store datetime information behind the scenes as the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. This date is largely considered the birth of modern-style computers. To read a Unix timestamp, use the datetime.fromtimestamp() method. Python will read your timestamp and return a datetime.\n",

    "\n",
    "**5. Creating timedeltas**\n",

Timedeltas can be created with any number of weeks, days, minutes, hours, seconds, or microseconds, and can be as small as a microsecond or as large as 2.7 million years.\n",
    "\n",

You can create timedeltas by subtracting two datetimes, which tells you how much time has elapsed between events. You can also create a timedelta directly, then add and subtract timedeltas from datetimes to make new datetimes. In the next few exercises, you'll see how these pieces can be combined together to answer more complex questions."
