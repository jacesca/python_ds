Problem was our UK vehicle registration states it is not proof of ownership. Eventually, with help of a fixer and a letter from a local agent requesting a 24 hour pass through the country we managed to meet with 'administration ' and persuade him that the truck was BFF ours and he gave us the full 60 day pass! Be very careful, they confiscate at least 1 car a week ( but these usually have Guatemalan or Salvador plates). I recommend using a fixer here, ours caught up with us on his motor bike, he asked $20 and I gave him $40 as without him it would have cost $600 to be escorted back to Mexico and another 90 days before we could  get back into Guatemala.

You need to make reservations online by going to marn.gob.sv and downloading and filling out a permit request form and emailing  to Cristina Ardon at ardon@marn.gob.sv to get your permit approved. (I'm adding the form we used for your rederence). Make sure you write down the exact days you'd plan to stat in the park.

It costs $3pp + $1 per vehicle to enter this park area.\r\n2. There are 3 possible hikes starting from here. All 3 hikes must have a guide. The two crater hikes also take armed police escorts for security.\r\na) a short 45min circular trail. Can go anytime. Trail is free, pay guide a tip (suggested $1).\r\nb) Izalco crater hike. 5hrs. Guide said it is steep & challenging. Rarely goes on weekdays unless pre-booked for a group. Demand is low due to the challenge but there's usually enough people at the weekends. Price $6 pp (foreigners) for trail in a special volcano zone, + $1 pp for guide. Leaves only at 11:00 hrs (no other times).\r\nc) Santa Ana crater hike. 4 hrs. Goes everyday (except rarely if less than 4 people turn up). Bit steep in parts but not too challenging. Leaves only at 11.00hrs. Must leave the crater rim at 13:00hrs to come down. If you are slow going up, you may have very little time at the top. This hike leaves from the main park (here) but the first section is steep downhill to Hotel Tibet.  You can intercept and join the hike either at Hotel Tibet at around 11:10 (you can park here for $2) or at the Santa Ana entry point at around 11:20 (see on maps.me and iOv - this is good if you are camping at Casa Cristal). There are 2 benefits with these 'shortcuts': (i) you don't pay the park entry fee to get to the start point; and (ii) you don't have to walk all the way back up the steep hill to the start-point to get your car afterwards. Hike price is $6+$1pp. \r\nWe did the Santa Ana hike from the start point and really regretted not having joined them at Hotel Tibet instead. By going to the start you pay the extra park entrance money just to do a tiring and boring section of the hike (walking back up at the end was hell!! üòê). Other than that, it's a great hike, spectacular views and highly recommended.\r\n","date_verified":"2019-03-15T00:00:00.000Z","category_icon_path":"/assets/icons/tourist-7729da997ac20278399b30237e1d0909.png","category_icon_pin_path":"/assets/icons/tourist-pin-9159a1ab84c01478c918805a76dedb31.png","amenities":{"Open":"Yes"},"country":"El Salvador","category":"Tourist Attraction","location":{"latitude":13.82692,"longitude":-89.62482,"altitude":0.0,"horizontal_accuracy":null,"vertical_accuracy":null}},{"id":63105,"name":"Seguros Qualitas","description":"We were told this is the only insurance company in El Salvador allowed to insure foreign vehicles.

They were very helpful and said it was unlikely to get anyone on a Sunday, also there do any seem to be too many mechanics around this way.\r\n\r\nAfter being chauffeured around by the police we met Geovanny (+50370123275).\r\nHe helped cancel the brakes and also remove in order to get the parts the following day in the city. We parked up in the Monkey Lala spot whilst the repair took place (opposite the police station).\r\n\r\nHe is a young and super eager mechanic who believes he's found an opening in this area for a mobile mechanic. He's super young (18) but he works with some pals and replaced our front brakes for $80 parts + $10 Sunday charge and $10 Monday charge - we bought the three street food and drinks on the Sunday and lunch on the Monday.\r\n\r\nA local guy we'd become friendly with said a day rate would be $10 - when we asked about tips etc. he advised not to be too generous otherwise it'd set a precedent for 'ripping off' or 'overcharging' foreigners in the future. We took this on board - spent around $15 on food for the lads and also think the parts were $70 so we left at that and we everyone was happy. \r\n\r\nThis guy is super attentive and hardworking and would get you out of a pickle if necessary in this area. He's a mobile mechanic - number above or seek assurance at the tourism police station in El Tunco.

Lured to the town on the promise of security, the citizens were separated into groups with the men locked in the church, and women and both girls and boys in nearby houses.  The next day the torture and killing began, men first, then the older women.  Young children were last.  Only one person escaped to tell the tale of what happened that day.  Others had fled before the invasion to the surrounding area east of Rio Sapo and therefore survived as well.\r\n\r\nToday there is a memorial in the village commemmorating the names and ages of those who lost their lives in El Mozote, Guacamaya and the other hamlets.\r\n\r\nWe were greeted upon arrival by a woman who told us the history of the event.  A small display shows photographs of the aftermath (not suitable for children), and there are books and CDs (in Spanish) you can purchase, along with handicrafts -- the money goes to help the ongoing effort to educate visitors about the tragic happenings (or you can make a contribution).\r\n\r\nThis makes a nice companion stop to the Museum of the Revolution in nearby Perquin.

He invited us to stay in his fields and said they are planning a camp area. He also plans to ride a motorcycle down the Pan American. It‚Äôs a great location, tucked away around the back of the farm in a grassy area up in a hill. The farm recently opened a cafe selling coffee (to drink, maybe beans too), cheese, milk and honey (all farm produced) as well as having young cow feeding times for kids and things like sugar cane crushing. \r\n\r\nThe bus to and from Juay√∫a is just 20c and you can catch it outside the farm or head 5 mins up the road to the small town of San Jose de Mojada and catch it from there.\r\n\r\nHe is happy to have Overlanders stay, he let us use the toilet and shower in the guest building and there is water available too if you need a tank fill (likely clean but not potable). They have electricity you can use but not at the site. You have the choice if where to stay in the fields, we chose the back corner as recommended by him. Some tight-ish corners through the farm but we were in easy enough in a long bed full ton Dodge Ram 3500 + camper. No height clearance issues.\r\n\r\nWe planned to stay a night and stayed two. Felt very welcome and secure, quiet too. The farm is also guarded at night. Expect an enthusiastic welcome from a pack of dachshunds and you may, like us, spot a quetzal in the trees nearby. A great stop for kids and adults alike. Check out the pictures for a better idea).\r\n\r\nWe were not charged. I am not sure this will continue forever, who knows. We purchased some cheese and milk etc. Alvaro seems to love travel more than profit :)\r\n\r\nRight next to a cell tower for full bars 3G Tigo (10 Mbs)and full bars LTE Claro (41Mbs ... yes, forty one!). Tested by Ookla. \r\n\r\nHappy to be adding this first, great friendly hosts. Enjoy!\r\n\r\nDirections: Just at the corner into / out of town you will see a bright red shed which is the cafe. The gate into the farm is just beside with two big tractor tires buried into the ground either side of the entrance. (See gate in pics)\r\n\r\nContact: probably best to contact first but they will likely be happy to accommodate you just turning up.
