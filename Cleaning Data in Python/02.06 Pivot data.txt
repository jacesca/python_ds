INSTRUCTION:
1. Print the head of airquality_melt.
2. Pivot airquality_melt by using .pivot_table() with 
   the rows indexed by 'Month' and 'Day', the columns 
   indexed by 'measurement', and the values populated 
   with 'reading'.
3. Print the head of airquality_pivot.

GUIDE:
Pivot data
Pivoting data is the opposite of melting it. 
Remember the tidy form that the airquality DataFrame 
was in before you melted it? You'll now begin pivoting 
it back into that form using the .pivot_table() method!

While melting takes a set of columns and turns it into 
a single column, pivoting will create a new column for 
each unique value in a specified column.

.pivot_table() has an index parameter which you can use 
to specify the columns that you don't want pivoted: It is 
similar to the id_vars parameter of pd.melt(). Two other 
parameters that you have to specify are columns (the name 
of the column you want to pivot), and values (the values 
to be used when the column is pivoted). The melted 
DataFrame airquality_melt has been pre-loaded for you.
