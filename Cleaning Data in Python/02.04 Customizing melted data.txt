INSTRUCTION:
1. Print the head of airquality.
2. Melt the columns of airquality with the default 
   variable column renamed to 'measurement' and the 
   default value column renamed to 'reading'. You can 
   do this by specifying, respectively, the varname 
   and valuename` parameters.
3. Print the head of airquality_melt.

GUIDE:
Customizing melted data
When melting DataFrames, it would be better to have 
column names more meaningful than variable and value 
(the default names used by pd.melt()).

The default names may work in certain situations, but 
it's best to always have data that is self explanatory.

You can rename the variable column by specifying an 
argument to the var_name parameter, and the value 
column by specifying an argument to the value_name 
parameter. You will now practice doing exactly this. 
Pandas as pd and the DataFrame airquality has been 
pre-loaded for you.
