Capítulo 4. Advanced Regular Expression Concepts
Introduction:
    In the last step of your journey, you will learn more complex methods of pattern matching using parentheses to group 
    strings together or to match the same text as matched previously. Also, you will get an idea of how you can look around 
    expressions.
