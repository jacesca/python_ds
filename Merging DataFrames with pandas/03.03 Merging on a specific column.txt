INSTRUCTION:

1. Using pd.merge(), merge the DataFrames revenue and 
   managers on the 'city' column of each. Store the result 
   as merge_by_city.
2. Print the DataFrame merge_by_city. This has been done 
   for you.
3. Merge the DataFrames revenue and managers on the 'branch_id' 
   column of each. Store the result as merge_by_id.
4. Print the DataFrame merge_by_id. This has been done for you, 
   so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

GUIDE:

Merging on a specific column
This exercise follows on the last one with the DataFrames 
revenue and managers for your company. You expect your 
company to grow and, eventually, to operate in cities with 
the same name on different states. As such, you decide that 
every branch should have a numerical branch identifier. Thus, 
you add a branch_id column to both DataFrames. Moreover, new 
cities have been added to both the revenue and managers 
DataFrames as well. pandas has been imported as pd and both 
DataFrames are available in your namespace.

At present, there should be a 1-to-1 relationship between the 
city and branch_id fields. In that case, the result of a merge 
on the city columns ought to give you the same output as a merge 
on the branch_id columns. Do they? Can you spot an ambiguity in 
one of the DataFrames?
