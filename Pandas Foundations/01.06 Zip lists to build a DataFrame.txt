INSTRUCTION:
1. Zip the 2 lists list_keys and list_values together 
   into one list of (key, value) tuples. Be sure to 
   convert the zip object into a list, and store the 
   result in zipped.
2. Inspect the contents of zipped using print(). This 
   has been done for you.
3. Construct a dictionary using zipped. Store the 
   result as data.
4. Construct a DataFrame using the dictionary. Store 
   the result as df.

GUIDE:
Zip lists to build a DataFrame
In this exercise, you're going to make a pandas 
DataFrame of the top three countries to win gold 
medals since 1896 by first building a dictionary. 
list_keys contains the column names 'Country' and 
'Total'. list_values contains the full names of 
each country and the number of gold medals awarded. 
The values have been taken from Wikipedia.

Your job is to use these lists to construct a list 
of tuples, use the list of tuples to construct a 
dictionary, and then use that dictionary to construct 
a DataFrame. In doing so, you'll make use of the list(), 
zip(), dict() and pd.DataFrame() functions. Pandas has 
already been imported as pd.

Note: The zip() function in Python 3 and above returns 
a special zip object, which is essentially a generator. 
To convert this zip object into a list, you'll need to 
use list(). You can learn more about the zip() function 
as well as generators in Python Data Science Toolbox 
(Part 2).
