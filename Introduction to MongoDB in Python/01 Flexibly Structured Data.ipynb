    "## 01.01 Intro to MongoDB and the Nobel Prize dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Welcome\n",
    ">Welcome to my intro to MongoDB with Python. MongoDB is a tool that helps you explore data without requiring it to have a strict, known structure. Because of this, you can handle diverse data together and unify analytics. You can also keep improving and fix issues as your requirements evolve. Most application programming interfaces - or APIs - on the web today expose a certain data format. If you can express your data in this format, then you can get started with MongoDB. Here's what I mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "2. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\n",
    ">Javascript is the language of web browsers. JavaScript Object Notation, or JSON, is a common way that web services and client code pass data. JSON is also the basis of MongoDB's data format. So, what is JSON? JSON has two collection structures. Objects map string keys to values, and arrays order values. Values, in turn, are one of a few things.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)\n",
    ">Values, in turn, are one of a few things. Values are strings, numbers, the value \"true\", the value \"false\", the value \"null\", or another object or array. That's it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. JSON <> Python\n",
    ">These JSON data types have equivalents in Python. JSON objects are like Python dictionaries with string-type keys. Arrays are like Python lists. And the values I mentioned also map to Python. For example, null in JSON maps to None in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. JSON <> Python <> MongoDB\n",
    ">Now, how are these JSON/Python types expressed in MongoDB? A database maps names to collections. You can access collections by name the same way you would access values in a Python dictionary. A collection, in turn, is like a list of dictionaries, called \"documents\" by MongoDB. When a dictionary is a value within a document, that's a subdocument. Values in a document can be any of the types I mentioned. MongoDB also supports some types native to Python but not to JSON. Two examples are dates and regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The Nobel Prize API data(base)\n",
    ">Let's make concrete how JSON maps to Python and in turn to MongoDB. Here is how I accessed the Nobel Prize API and collected its data into a Mongo database for you. First, I import the requests library, which will get the data from the API. I also import the MongoClient class from pymongo. Pymongo is the official Python driver for MongoDB. Then, I connect to my local database server. I say that I want a database with the name \"nobel\", and MongoDB creates it. Finally, I gather JSON responses for the \"prize\" and \"laureate\" endpoints. I insert them into the \"prizes\" and \"laureates\" collections, which Mongo also creates for me.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Accessing databases and collections\n",
    ">Now, let's go over how to count documents in a collection, and how to find one to inspect. First, a note on accessing databases and collections from a client object. One way is square bracket notation, as if a client is a dictionary of databases, with database names as keys. A database in turn is like a dictionary of collections, with collection names as keys. Another way to access things is dot notation. Databases are attributes of a client, and collections are attributes of a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Count documents in a collection\n",
    ">To count documents, use the \"count_documents \" collection method. Pass a filter document to limit what you count. In this case, I want an unfiltered total count, so I pass an empty document as the filter. Finally, you can fetch a document and infer the schema of the raw JSON data given by the Nobel Prize API. Use the find_one method, again with no filter, to grab a document from the collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Let's practice!\n",
    ">Now, let's practice. You'll access databases and collections from a connected client. You'll count documents, and you'll inspect them."

    "## 01.05 Finding documents\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding documents\n",
    ">In the last lesson, we learned about databases, collections, and documents. We also learned how data structures in MongoDB relate to those of JSON and Python. In this lesson, we will learn how to query a collection to find documents of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An example \"laureates\" document\n",
    ">Here we have an example document in the laureates collection. Finding documents in MongoDB reminds me of the work of this particular laureate. The remarkable rays named after him are today called x-rays.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Filters as (sub)documents\n",
    ">To find documents satisfying some criteria, we express those criteria as a document. This filter document mirrors the structure of documents to match in the collection. Imagine a filter document as an x-ray image like the one on the right. This image is one of the first x-ray images ever recorded. Imagine you use it to filter by eye a collection of color photos of people's hands. You might keep ones with five fingers and a ring on the ring finger.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. The Walrus is Out\n",
    ">Here's another way to think about filter documents. Hold a pair of pants up to a collection of mammals, one at a time. The pants fit a part of the structure of human beings, but not that of a walrus. Sorry, Wally.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Simple filters\n",
    ">Filter documents can be small. For example, there are 48 laureate documents with a value for the field gender equal to female. We can do the same for other fields, like country of death and city of birth. Also, we can merge criteria into a single filter document.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Composing filters\n",
    ">This filter document will have the same form as matching documents. In this case, the filter matches Marie Curie. She discovered the element polonium, named after her native land. Poland was under Russian rule at the time. She hoped that naming an element after it would publicize its lack of independence. Many immigrants won Nobel Prizes, but in what proportion? Later exercises in the course will explore this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Query operators\n",
    ">We've seen filters that match exact values in a document. What about satisfying other constraints? Query operators are like different ways to input values on a website form. Some values you select from options, like countries; some you select with a range slider. All operators on fields wrap around their corresponding values. You might operate a drop-down menu to select a country and a slider to pick a value in a range. Query operators in MongoDB work the same way. You place an operator in a filter document to wrap around a field and its acceptable values.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Query operators\n",
    ">For example, let's find documents where the field 'diedCountry' is either France or USA. We use the \"in\" operator to wrap around acceptable values. Operators in MongoDB have a dollar-sign prefix. Another example. To find documents where 'diedCountry' is not equal to a certain string, we can use the not-equal - or en ee - operator We can compose query operators for a field.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Query operators\n",
    ">For example, here we query for documents with 'diedCountry' greater than - or gee tee - the string 'Belgium'. At the same time, we query for 'diedCountry' less than or equal to - or el tee ee - the string 'USA'. How rude that MongoDB considers some countries to be greater than or less than others! Actually, this highlights MongoDB's loose requirements for comparisons. Comparison operators order values in lexicographic order, meaning alphabetical order for non-numeric values. This behavior is something to keep in mind when working with raw, unprocessed data.\n",
    "\n",

In this lesson, we are going to learn how to query arrays and subdocuments using dot notation. Dot notation is how MongoDB allows us to query document substructure.\n",

Notice that the \"prizes\" field is an array. In this case, the array has one element with data on Kohn's two-way share of the 1998 prize in chemistry. Note also that a laureate may have many affiliations for a prize. The affiliations field of each prize subdocument is an array. To fit text on this slide, I use parentheses to form multiline strings, and I show only part of the document. MongoDB allows you to query document substructure using dot notation. Here's a count of laureates. We reach into the prizes array to query on the affiliations field across prizes. From there, we reach again, this time to query on the name field across affiliations. We count laureates with at least one prize affiliation name as specified. The dot notation gives a full path to a field from the document root. I'm curious how many laureates had an affiliation in Berkeley, CA when they received a prize. Here's my query. Go Bears!\n",

In the case of this laureate, there is an \"empty\" affiliation associated with his prize. Another accommodation in MongoDB is that of field presence. Even root-level fields don't need to be present in all documents. In this document, for example, the \"bornCountry\" field is absent. Using the \"exists\" operator, We can query for the existence, or non-existence of fields. Here, we see that many laureates documents do not have a \"bornCountry\" field.\n",

We can check using dot notation to access array elements. This borrows from javascript syntax. Here we see a filter document for the criteria that a value exists for the field \"0\" within the \"prizes\" field. You can reference an array element by its numerical index using dot notation. Thus, this expression counts documents that have a non-empty prizes array. We see, to our relief, that all laureate documents contain at least one prize. Are there laureates with more than one prize? Yes! We see that Marie Curie is in this group, along with a few other people you may recognize.\n",
