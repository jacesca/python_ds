INSTRUCTION:
1. Open moby_dick.txt using the with context manager  
   and the variable file.
2. Print the first three lines of the file to the  
   shell by using readline() three times within the  
   context manager.

GUIDE:
Importing text files line by line
For large files, we may not want to print all of their 
content to the shell: you may wish to print only the 
first few lines. Enter the readline() method, which 
allows you to do this. When a file called file is open, 
you can print out the first line by executing 
file.readline(). If you execute the same command again, 
the second line will print, and so on.

In the introductory video, Hugo also introduced the 
concept of a context manager. He showed that you can 
bind a variable file by using a context manager construct:

	with open('huck_finn.txt') as file:

While still within this construct, the variable file 
will be bound to open('huck_finn.txt'); thus, to print 
the file to the shell, all the code you need to 
execute is:

with open('huck_finn.txt') as file:
    print(file.readline())

You'll now use these tools to print the first few lines 
of moby_dick.txt!
