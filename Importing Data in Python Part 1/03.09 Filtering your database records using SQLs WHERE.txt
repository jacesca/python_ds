INSTRUCTION:
1. Complete the argument of create_engine() so that the 
   engine for the SQLite database 'Chinook.sqlite' is 
   created.
2. Execute the query that selects all records from the 
   Employee table where 'EmployeeId' is greater than or 
   equal to 6. Use the >= operator and assign the 
   results to rs.
3. Apply the method fetchall() to rs in order to fetch 
   all records in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
4. Using the rs object, set the DataFrame's column names 
   to the corresponding names of the table columns.

GUIDE:
Filtering your database records using SQL's WHERE
You can now execute a basic SQL query to select records 
from any table in your database and you can also perform 
simple query customizations to select particular columns 
and numbers of rows.

There are a couple more standard SQL query chops that 
will aid you in your journey to becoming an SQL ninja.

Let's say, for example that you wanted to get all records 
from the Customer table of the Chinook database for which 
the Country is 'Canada'. You can do this very easily in 
SQL using a SELECT statement followed by a WHERE clause 
as follows:

	SELECT * FROM Customer WHERE Country = 'Canada'

In fact, you can filter any SELECT statement by any 
condition using a WHERE clause. This is called filtering 
your records.

In this interactive exercise, you'll select all records 
of the Employee table for which 'EmployeeId' is greater 
than or equal to 6.

Packages are already imported as follows:

	import pandas as pd
	from sqlalchemy import create_engine

Query away!
