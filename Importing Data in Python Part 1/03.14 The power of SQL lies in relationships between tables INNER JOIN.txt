INSTRUCTION:
1. Assign to rs the results from the following query: 
   select all the records, extracting the Title of the 
   record and Name of the artist of each record from 
   the Album table and the Artist table, respectively. 
   To do so, INNER JOIN these two tables on the ArtistID 
   column of both.
2. In a call to pd.DataFrame(), apply the method 
   fetchall() to rs in order to fetch all records 
   in rs. Store them in the DataFrame df.
3. Set the DataFrame's column names to the corresponding 
   names of the table columns.

GUIDE:
The power of SQL lies in relationships between tables: 
INNER JOIN
Here, you'll perform your first INNER JOIN! You'll be 
working with your favourite SQLite database, 
Chinook.sqlite. For each record in the Album table, 
you'll extract the Title along with the Name of the 
Artist. The latter will come from the Artist table 
and so you will need to INNER JOIN these two tables 
on the ArtistID column of both.

Recall that to INNER JOIN the Orders and Customers 
tables from the Northwind database, Hugo executed 
the following SQL query:

	"SELECT OrderID, CompanyName FROM Orders 
	 INNER JOIN Customers on 
	 Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID"
