INSTRUCTION:
1. Import the package h5py.
2. Assign the name of the file to the variable file.
3. Load the file as read only into the variable data.
4. Print the datatype of data.
5. Print the names of the groups in the HDF5 file 
   'LIGO_data.hdf5'.

GUIDE:
Using h5py to import HDF5 files
The file 'LIGO_data.hdf5' is already in your working 
directory. In this exercise, you'll import it using 
the h5py library. You'll also print out its datatype 
to confirm you have imported it correctly. You'll then 
study the structure of the file in order to see precisely 
what HDF groups it contains.

You can find the LIGO data plus loads of documentation 
and tutorials here. There is also a great tutorial on 
Signal Processing with the data here.
