INSTRUCTION:
1. Use the pandas function read_sql_query() to assign 
   to the variable df the DataFrame of results from the 
   following query: 
	
	select all records 
	from PlaylistTrack 
	INNER JOIN Track 
	on PlaylistTrack.TrackId = Track.TrackId 
   
   that satisfy the condition Milliseconds < 250000.

GUIDE:
Filtering your INNER JOIN
Congrats on performing your first INNER JOIN! You're now 
going to finish this chapter with one final exercise in 
which you perform an INNER JOIN and filter the result 
using a WHERE clause.

Recall that to INNER JOIN the Orders and Customers tables 
from the Northwind database, Hugo executed the following 
SQL query:

	"SELECT OrderID, CompanyName FROM Orders 
	 INNER JOIN Customers on 
	 Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID"

The following code has already been executed to import 
the necessary packages and to create the engine:

	import pandas as pd
	from sqlalchemy import create_engine
	engine = create_engine('sqlite:///Chinook.sqlite')
