    "\n",
    "1. Building a bag of words model\n",
    ">In this chapter, we will cover vectorization which is, as you may recall, the process of converting text into vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Recap of data format for ML algorithms\n",
    ">Recall that for any ML algorithm to run properly, data fed into it must be in tabular form and all the training features must be numerical. This is clearly not the case for textual data. In this lesson, we will learn a technique called bag of words that converts text documents into vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Bag of words model\n",
    ">The bag of words model is a procedure of extracting word tokens from a text document (henceforth, we will refer to this as just document), computing the frequency of these word tokens and constructing a word vector based on these frequencies and the vocabulary of the entire corpus of documents. This is best explained with the help of an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Bag of words model example\n",
    ">Consider a corpus of three documents. The lion is the king of the jungle. Lions have an average lifespan of 15 years. And, the lion is an endangered species.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Bag of words model example\n",
    ">We now extract the unique word tokens that occur in this corpus of documents. This will be the vocabulary of our model. In this example, the following 15 word tokens will constitute our vocabulary. Since there are 15 words in our vocabulary, our word vectors will have 15 dimensions and each dimension's value will correspond to the frequency of the word token corresponding to that dimension. For instance, the second dimension will correspond to the number of times the second word in the vocabulary, an, occurs in the document. Let's now convert our documents into word vectors using this bag of words model. The lion is the king of the jungle is converted to the following vector. Similarly, the other two sentences have the following word vector representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Text preprocessing\n",
    ">As we were constructing this model, you may have noticed how text preprocessing would have been extremely useful in creating arguably better models. We would usually want Lions and lion to mean the same thing and therefore, counted as the same thing. The same applies to 'the' with different cases. We would also want to remove punctuations and stopwords as they are extremely common and don't really contribute much to the character of the document. Performing text preprocessing usually leads to smaller vocabularies, which is a good thing. While working with vectorization, it is routine to form word vectors running into thousands of dimensions and keeping this to a minimum helps improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Bag of words model using sklearn\n",
    ">To construct the bag of words model in Python, we will use the scikit-learn library. We will use the corpus from before, consisting of the three sentences on lions. Let's ignore text preprocessing for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Bag of words model using sklearn\n",
    ">We import the CountVectorizer class from sklearn.feature_extraction.text. This is the class that will help us build our bag of words model. Next, we instantiate a CountVectorizer object vectorizer. We finally create our matrix of word vectors by passing corpus to the fit_transform method of vectorizer. This is stored in bow_matrix. This bow_matrix is a sparse matrix and we can print out its 2D array form using bow matrix dot toarray(). This gives us the following output. Notice how this is different from the word vectors we generated. This is because CountVectorizer automatically lowercases words and ignores single character tokens such as 'a'. Also, it doesn't necessarily index the vocabulary in alphabetical order. We will learn how to map the vocabulary to the indices in the exercises. We can now use this bow_matrix as our training features in ML models.\n",

    "## 3.6 Building a BoW Naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Building a BoW Naive Bayes classifier\n",
    ">In this lesson, we will walk through a machine learning problem that utilizes feature engineering techniques we've learned, to arrive at a desired result.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Spam filtering\n",
    ">Let's take a look at the spam filtering problem. We're given a dataset of messages that have been labelled as spam or ham. Here, you can see a typical spam and ham message. Our task is to train an ML model that can predict the label given a particular text.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Steps\n",
    ">There are 3 steps involved. The first is to preprocess the text. Next, we proceed to build the bag-of-words model. Finally, we conduct predictive modeling using the generated BoW vectors. Note that although we use the term 'modeling' in the context of both BoW and machine learning, they mean two different things.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Text preprocessing using CountVectorizer\n",
    ">We've already learned how to conduct text preprocessing using spaCy. However, it is also possible to do this using CountVectorizer. CountVectorizer takes in a number of arguments to perform preprocessing. The lowercase argument, when set to True, converts words to lowercase. The strip_accents argument can convert accented characters according to unicode or ASCII mapping. Passing in a stopwords argument will lead to CountVectorizer ignoring stopwords. You can pass in a custom list or the string 'english' to use scikit-learn's list of English stopwords. You can specify tokenization using a regular expression as the value of the token_pattern argument. Tokenization can also be specified using a tokenizer argument. Here, you can pass a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a list of tokens. This way, CountVectorizer allows usage of spaCy's tokenization techniques. CountVectorizer cannot perform certain steps such as lemmatization automatically. This is where spaCy is useful. Although it performs tokenization and preprocessing, CountVectorizer's main job is to convert a corpus into a matrix of numerical vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Building the BoW model\n",
    ">As usual, we import CountVectorizer from scikit-learn. We then instantiate a CountVectorizer object called vectorizer. We perform accent stripping using ASCII mapping and remove English stopwords. We also set the lowercase argument to False. This is because spam messages usually tend to abuse all-capital words and we might want to preserve this information for the ML step. The dataset has been already been loaded into the dataframe df. We split this dataset into training and test sets using scikit-learn's train test split function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Building the BoW model\n",
    ">We now fit the vectorizer on the training set and transform it into its bag-of-words representation. We can perform both these steps together using the fit transform method. Next, we transform the test set into its BoW representation. Note, that we do not fit the vectorizer with the test data. It is possible that there are some words in the test data that is not in the vocabulary of the vectorizer. In such cases, CountVectorizer simply ignores these words.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Training the Naive Bayes classifier\n",
    ">We're now in a good position to train an ML model. We will use the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier for this task. We import the Multinomial NB class from scikit-learn and create an object named clf. We then fit the training BoW vectors and their corresponding labels to clf. We can now test the performance of our model. We compute the accuracy of the model on the test set using clf dot score. In this case, our model registered an accuracy of 76% on the test set.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Let's practice!\n",
    ">We've covered a lot of ground in building a spam filter in this lesson. In the exercises, we will perform similar steps to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews. Let's practice!"

    "\n",
    "1. Building n-gram models\n",
    ">We already know how to build bag-of-words representations of our documents and use it to conduct various machine learning tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. BoW shortcomings\n",
    ">Consider the following mini reviews. One is a positive review which states that the movie was good and not boring. The other is negative; commenting that the movie was not good and boring. If we were to construct BoW vectors for these reviews, we would get identical vectors since both reviews contain exactly the same words. And here in lies the biggest shortcoming of the bag-of-words model: context of the words is lost. In this example, the position of the word 'not' changes the entire sentiment of the review. Therefore, in this lesson, we will study techniques that will allow us to model this.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. n-grams\n",
    ">An n-gram is a contiguous sequence of n elements (or words) in a given document. The bag-of-words model that we've explored so far is nothing but an n-gram model where n is equal to one. Let's now explore n-grams when n is greater than one. Consider the sentence 'for you a thousand times over'. If we set n to 2, then the n-grams (called bigrams in this case) would be for you, you a, a thousand, thousand times and times over.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. n-grams\n",
    ">Similarly, for n equal to 3, the n-grams (or trigrams) will be for you a, you a thousand, a thousand times, thousand times over. Therefore, we can use these n-grams to capture more context and account for cases like 'not'.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Applications\n",
    ">Apart from capturing more context, n-grams have a host of other useful applications. They are used in sentence completion, spelling correction and machine translation correction. In all these cases, the model computes the probability of n words occurring contiguously to perform the above processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Building n-gram models using scikit-learn\n",
    ">Building these n-gram models using scikit-learn is extremely simple, now that we know how to use CountVectorizer. CountVectorizer takes in an argument ngram range which is a tuple containing the lower and upper bound for the range of n-values. For instance, passing 2,2 as the ngram_range will generate only bigrams. On the other hand, passing in 1,3 will generate n-grams where n is equal to 1, 2 and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Shortcomings\n",
    ">While on the surface, it may seem lucrative to generate n-grams of high orders to capture more and more context, it comes with caveats. We've already seen that the BoW vectors run into thousands of dimensions. Adding higher order n-grams increases the number of dimensions even more and while performing machine learning, leads to a problem known as the curse of dimensionality. Additionally, n-grams for n greater than 3 become exceedingly rare to find in multiple documents. So that feature becomes effectively useless. For these reasons, it is often a good idea to restrict yourself to n-grams where n is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Let's practice!\n",
    ">Great! Let's now build these advanced n-gram models and discover more insights in the exercises."

    "You now know how to conduct sentiment analysis by converting text into various n-gram representations and feeding them to a classifier. In this exercise, we will conduct sentiment analysis for the same movie reviews from before using two n-gram models: unigrams and n-grams upto n equal to 3.\n",

    "<font color=darkgreen>Amazing work! The program took around 0.2 seconds in the case of the unigram model and more than 10 times longer for the higher order n-gram model. The unigram model had over 12,000 features whereas the n-gram model for upto n=3 had over 178,000! Despite taking higher computation time and generating more features, the classifier only performs marginally better in the latter case, producing an accuracy of 77% in comparison to the 75% for the unigram model.</font>"
